#summary Bug fixes in GWT 1.5

= Bug Fixes in GWT 1.5 =

  * DOM.setInnerText now has consistent behavior across browsers -- the IE version does not translate whitespace.
  * Fixed bug in Arrays.deepHashCode.
  * History tokens more consistently escaped (characters were needlessly
getting escaped before), this prevents some spurious history entries.
  * Resolved [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1440 Issue #1440], where very large methods or programs would sometimes fail to parse on IE.
  * Resolved [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1336 Issue #1336], where certain RPC responses would not be decoded on IE.
