#summary Bug fixes in GWT 1.5

= Bug Fixes in GWT 1.5 =

  * Fixed bug in Arrays.deepHashCode.

  * History tokens more consistently escaped (characters were needlessly getting escaped before), this prevents some spurious history entries.

  * Resolved [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1440 Issue #1440], where very large methods or programs would sometimes fail to parse on IE.

  * Resolved [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1336 Issue #1336], where certain RPC responses would not be decoded on IE.

=== Known bugs ===

  * !StackPanel in standards mode 
  Currently, the !StackPanel has an issue in IE in standards mode that makes it difficult to set the height of a !StackPanel reliably, particularly in IE. This is an issue that is targeted for priority attention for the next release of 1.5.
