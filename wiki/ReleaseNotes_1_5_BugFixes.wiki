#summary Bug fixes in GWT 1.5

= Bug Fixes in GWT 1.5 =

  * Fixed bug in Arrays.deepHashCode.

  * History tokens more consistently escaped (characters were needlessly getting escaped before), this prevents some spurious history entries.

  * Resolved [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1440 Issue #1440], where very large methods or programs would sometimes fail to parse on IE.

  * Resolved [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=1336 Issue #1336], where certain RPC responses would not be decoded on IE.

=== Known bugs ===

  * !StackPanel in standards mode 
  Currently, the !StackPanel has an issue in IE in standards mode that makes it difficult to set the height of a !StackPanel reliably.  The problem is that the height of the visible TD cell is set to 100%, which effectively means "take whatever space is left over" in all browsers (including IE) in standards mode.  However, tables cannot act as layout parents in IE in standards mode, so the visible TD cell ends up taking the height of the body or the parent of the !StackPanel. This is an issue that is targeted for priority attention for the next release of 1.5.
