#summary My ImageBundle images show up in Firefox, Opera and Safari, but aren't showing up in Internet Explorer. What's the deal?

= Why aren't my !ImageBundle images showing in IE? =

The first thing to verify is whether or not your web application uses HTTPS, or if any of the images included in the generated image bundle file are under a security constraint. If that is the case, you may be running into a problem rooted in your web server setting certain response headers (e.g. `Pragma: No-cache, Expires: Thu, 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00,` ...) and Internet Explorer respecting those headers when when using the HTTPS protocol. You can read more details about this problem and how to work around it [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.4/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/ImageBundle.html here].

On the other hand, if you're not using HTTPS but are still running into this problem, check out the size of your image bundle file. A number of developers have run into the problem of Internet Explorer consuming large amounts of memory when extracting images out of a larger image bundle, and subsequently failing to properly display the images. You may want to consider splitting up one large image bundle into several smaller size bundles. This technique has worked for most developers who have experienced this problem.
