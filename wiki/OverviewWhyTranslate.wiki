=Why translate Java code to !JavaScript?=

Java technologies offer a productive development plaform, and with GWT, they can instantly become the basis of your AJAX development platform as well. Here are some of the benefits of developing with GWT:

 * You can use all of your favorite Java development tools ([http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse], [http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ IntelliJ], [http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html JProfiler], [http://www.junit.org/ JUnit]) for AJAX development.
 * Static type checking in the Java language boosts productivity while reducing errors.
 * Common !JavaScript errors (typos, type mismatches) are easily caught at compile time rather than by users at runtime.
 * Code prompting/completion is widely available.
 * Automated Java refactoring is pretty snazzy these days.
 * Java-based OO designs are easier to communicate and understand, thus making your AJAX code base more comprehensible with less documentation.
