#summary Things that could surprise you if you've been using previous versions of GWT

= Important notes =

If you have already been using GWT for a while, there are some changes in 1.5 that might affect your development. They aren't really breaking API changes, but they could trip you up, so we wanted to call them out clearly.

=== GWT 1.5 requires Java 5 or later ===
You probably have already been using a Java 5 SDK with GWT already, but if not, you'll need to make the switch now.

=== You'll want to start using generics and annotations... ==
...especially for [DevGuideRemoteProcedureCalls RPC], [DevGuideInternationalization internationalization], and [DevGuideImageBundles image bundles]. All the old javadoc-style metadata such as `@gwt.typeArgs` has been superceded by proper annotations. Future versions of GWT will no longer honor the javadoc style of annotations, so expect to see a lot of log warnings  reminding you to update your code to use annotations. 

For RPC, you'll need to replace `@gwt.typeArgs` in your javadoc with proper Java generics.

For internationalization, there is a new, rich set of annotations. See the "Annotation Types" section for [http://google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/package-summary.html Constants and Messages].

For image bundles, replace `@gwt.resource` in your javadoc with the [http://google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/ImageBundle.Resource.html @Resource] annotation.

=== Expect to use the -Xmx JVM flag ===
The GWT compiler and hosted mode use more memory internally now. Some projects will need to increase JVM max memory to successfully compile, others may see improved compile times by increasing the limit. For example, `-Xmx512M` would set the heap max to 512 megabytes.

=== Assertions are always on in hosted mode ===
GWT client code running in hosted mode always runs with assertions enabled now. The GWT libraries are increasingly using assertions to validate proper use of API methods rather than explicitly checking parameters via if/then/throw sequences. Using assertions in this manner helps you catch runtime bugs in hosted mode without forcing overhead in [DevGuideWebMode web mode]. (You can choose to compile-in assertions in web mode, too, now. See [DevGuideModuleCompileScript the command-line] for `GWTCompiler` for more details.)

=== Hosted mode works on OS X 10.5 and requires Safari 3.0 ===
The same GWT distribution for Mac OS X now works on Tiger (10.4) and Leopard (10.5). The new implementation relies on using the system's available install of Safari 3.0 or later rather than bundling its own version of WebKit.
