#summary Important "big picture" information for users of GWT 1.5

= Important Notes =

If you have already been using GWT for a while, there are some changes in 1.5 that might affect your development. They aren't really breaking API changes, but they could trip you up, so we wanted to call them out clearly.

==== GWT 1.5 requires Java 5 or later ====
You probably have already been using a Java 5 SDK with GWT already, but if not, you'll need to make the switch now.

==== Expect to use the -Xmx JVM flag ====
The GWT compiler and hosted mode use more memory internally now. Some projects will need to increase JVM max memory to successfully compile, others may see improved compile times by increasing the limit. For example, `-Xmx512M` would set the heap max to 500 megabytes.

==== Assertions are always on in hosted mode ====
GWT client code running in hosted mode always runs with assertions enabled now. The GWT libraries are increasingly using assertions to validate proper use of API methods rather than explicitly checking parameters via if/then/throw sequences. Using assertions in this manner helps you catch runtime bugs in hosted mode without forcing overhead in [DevGuideWebMode web mode]. (You can choose to compile-in assertions in web mode, too, now. See [DevGuideModuleCompileScript the command-line] for `GWTCompiler` for more details.)
