#summary Important "big picture" information for users of GWT 1.5

= Important Notes =

==== Expect to use the -Xmx JVM flag ====
  The GWT compiler and hosted mode use more memory internally now. Some projects will need to increase JVM max memory to successfully compile, others may see improved compile times by increasing the limit. For example, `-Xmx500M` would set the heap max to 500 megabytes.

==== Assertions are always on in hosted mode ====
  GWT client code running in hosted mode always runs with assertions enabled now. The GWT libraries are increasingly using assertions to validate proper use of API methods rather than explicitly checking parameters via if/then/throw sequences. Using assertions in this manner helps you catch runtime bugs in hosted mode without forcing overhead in [DevGuideWebMode web mode]. (You can choose to compile-in assertions in web mode, too, now. See [DevGuideModuleCompileScript the command-line] for `GWTCompiler` for more details.)
