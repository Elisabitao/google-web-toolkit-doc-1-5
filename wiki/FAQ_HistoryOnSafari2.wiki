#summary GWT's History feature is great, but it has been driving me bananas on Safari 2.0. What's the History between GWT and Safari 2.0?

= GWT's History feature is broken on Safari 2.0! =

Unfortunately, the GWT History system does not play well with Safari 2.0.

There are a number of strange bugs in Safari 2 that make it hard to use the same tricks GWT uses for history support in IE and Firefox and that are particularly difficult to work around. There exist some messy solutions out there that do offer support for history in Safari 2, but these fail in a number of significant edge cases and are not likely to be good long term solutions.

However, although the current GWT solution for history support doesn't completely work on Safari 3 beta, it has been tested on the latest nightly !WebKit builds and is looking good. Also, the current implementation provides fall-back functionality for Safari 2 so that the library works, but no history entries are generated. So, hold on to your hats! History support for Safari will work properly when Safari 3 is officially released.
