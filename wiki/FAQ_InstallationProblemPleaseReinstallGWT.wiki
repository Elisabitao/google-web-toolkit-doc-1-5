#summary RuntimeException: Installation problem detected, please reinstall GWT

= RuntimeException: Installation problem detected, please reinstall GWT =

This message occurs when you launch the GWT compiler or hosted mode, and the path to the runtime binary installation of GWT cannot be located.

Usually, this path is embedded in the scripts that are created from [DevGuideApplicationCreator applicationCreator] and [DevGuideProjectCreator projectCreator].  The path should contain not only `gwt-user.jar` and `gwt-dev-<platform>.jar`, but also the platform specific shared library files, such as `libgwt_ll.so` or `libgwt_ll.jnilib`.  Make sure that the path specified on the classpath still contains the shared libraries.  If not, you may need to re-install.

For developers running GWT from source, make sure you also have a binary distribution or pre-compiled source unpacked and have set the system property `gwt.devjar` configured in your launch configurations as specified in the file `eclipse/README.txt`.
