#summary Improvements to the I18N library

= I18N Improvements =

=== Bi-directional support for standard widgets ===

The standard GWT widgets have been improved to support bidirectionality, as shown in the Showcase application. This represents significant support for right-to-left languages. See Bi-di support section in [ReleaseNotes_1_5_Ui User interface improvements] for more details.

=== Support for text and metadata in Java annotations ===

GWT 1.5 supports and honors Java 1.5 syntax, and as a result, you can use Java annotations for text or metadata representations which can be adapted from general purpose use to i18n purposes.

=== Support for plural forms, including rules for 99 languages ===


=== Support for integration with external translation tools ===


=== New !LocaleInfo class lets you access information about the client locale ===

The new [http://google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/LocaleInfo.html LocaleInfo] class has been introduced in GWT 1.5 that allows you to discover more information about the client locale your application is running in. The [http://google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.5/com/google/gwt/i18n/client/LocaleInfo.html LocaleInfo] class can also return the list of locales available on the given client.
