= How can I coerce a JSON !JavaScriptObject into a GWT JSONObject? =

Previous to GWT 1.4, the only way to do this was to convert the !JavaScriptObject back into text representation, and then invoke `JSONParser.parse()`. You would have to incorporate a JSON encoder/stringifier, such as the open source implementation available at `http://www.json.org/json.js`, and use it to convert the !JavaScriptObject back into a text representation. From that point, you would write a JSNI method to invoke `toJSONString()` on the !JavaScriptObject, and then pass it to `JSONParser.parse()`.

In GWT 1.4, we made this process a lot easier by making constructors for [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.4/com/google/gwt/json/client/JSONObject.html JSONObject] and [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/1.4/com/google/gwt/json/client/JSONArray.html JSONArray] that take !JavaScriptObject values as constructor arguments. So if you had some !JavaScriptObject `value` object that you wanted to coerce into a JSONObject, all you would need to do is create the JSONObject by passing in the `value` as a constructor argument, as shown below.

{{{
JSONObject jsonValue = new JSONObject(value);
}}}
