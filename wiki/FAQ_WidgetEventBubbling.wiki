= How can I efficiently handle events from many interior Widgets? =

Wi
hen using a GWT event handler, GWT hides all this away from you and delivers events only for the element you are interested in.  This is a wonderful programming abstraction, but can lead to slow performance when many handlers are added to the system. 

If you are building a widget, you may want to consider handling events in a different way, called Event Bubbling.   Quirksmode has a writeup of the background behind [http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html Event Bubbling] in how different browsers deliver events.  

See the [http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/releases/1.5/user/src/com/google/gwt/user/client/ui/Tree.java implementation of the Tree] class for an example of using Event Bubbling in GWT.
