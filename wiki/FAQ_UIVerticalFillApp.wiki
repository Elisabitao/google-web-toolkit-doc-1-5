Creating an application that fills the browser window can be a challenge for web application designers.  The underlying problem is that different browsers treat the CSS specification of "100%" for height in different ways.  The [http://gwt.google.com/samples/Mail/Mail.html Mail sample application] demonstrates a simple cross-browser technique using GWT.  

The Mail sample instead uses absolute (pixel) units to set the outermost Widget's height.   Then, it adds a window resize handler in order to reset the height of the widget whenever the broweser window changes size.  Here is a code snippet:

{{{
   final VerticalPanel vp = new VerticalPanel();
   vp.add(mainPanel);
   vp.setWidth("100%");
   vp.setHeight(Window.getClientHeight() + "px");
   Window.addWindowResizeListener(new WindowResizeListener() {

     public void onWindowResized(int width, int height) {
       vp.setHeight(height + "px");
     }
   });
   RootPanel.get().add(vp);
}}}

The above code snippet has been tested to work on Internet Explorer, Safari, and Firefox.  

Note that the use of the type of panel is significant.  If you decide to change the outer widget to a different type of panel or widget, make sure you test your application on all your target browsers.
