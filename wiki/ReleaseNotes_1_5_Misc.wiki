= Miscellaneous Features & Improvements =

* * Application creator now creates a default css file *: If your application's name is MyApp, then the default css file will be named MyApp.css.

* *Binary only annotations can be used in translatable source *: Of course, this is in addition source only annotations.

* * Generators *:
  * Expose Java 1.5 constructs like annotations and generics to Generator authors
  * Generators can now mark Artifacts created by GeneratorContext.tryCreateResource() as being private; these files will be emitted into the module's auxiliary directory. This is a change that ties into the new Linker subsystem introduced in 1.5.
  * Generators can now send custom Artifact instances to the Linker stack via
GeneratorContext.commitArtifact(). This change also ties into the new Linker subsystem.

* * New <rename-to> module XML tag *: The module XML file now supports an optional attribute "rename-to" which will change the name of the module produced by the compiler. This allows you to do such things as create drop-in replacements for your module by creating various working modules that can be renamed to your standard module name.

* * Call Java constructors from JSNI code *
Java constructors can now be called directly from JSNI via the ::new method reference.

* * Added GWTTestSuite classes to optimize the order in which GWTTestCases are executed. *

* * Upgraded DateTimeConstants data to CLDR 1.51, and added the firstDayOfTheWeek
and weekendRange formatting symbols. *

* Removed dependency on java.util.Locale in LocalizableGenerator for BCP47
compatibility. *

* User.gwt.xml now inherits the I18N module because standard widgets now support bidi. *
